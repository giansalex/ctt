# XDT Transformation Tool
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jojpj3hrtka55akt?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/giansalex/ctt)   

XDT Transformation tool is a command tool based on [XDT (web.config) transform engine](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.Xdt), which allows you to run XDT transformation on any XML files.

Scott Guthrie: _"In most real-world deployment scenarios, the web.config file you use for development is different than the one you use for production deployment. Typically you want to change environment settings like database connection-strings, making sure debug is turned off, and enabling custom errors so that end-users (and hackers) donâ€™t see the internals of your application."_
